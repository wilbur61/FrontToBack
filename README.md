Creating a Simple HTML Table in Java Front to Back End COMPLETE

Understanding the Requirements:

Create Java code.
Create a simple but nice  HTML table.
Table columns should be: ticker, qty, price, tradeDate.
Assumptions:

You have a data structure (e.g., List, Array) containing objects with the required fields (ticker, qty, price, tradeDate).
You want to output the HTML to Screen


Explanation:

We use Bootstrap for basic table styling (optional).
We iterate over a list named stocks using th:each.
Each row in the table body (<tbody>) represents a single stockData object.
Thymeleaf expressions (th:text) access the object properties (ticker, qty, price, tradeDate).

New stuff!!!   jumping the gun a bit here but..  hey better early than late

Spring Boot Controller and Model 

This is an example of how you might send data to the Thymeleaf template from a Spring Boot controller.
